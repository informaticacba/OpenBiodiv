It is an one of several natural history collections affiliated with Cornell University. The CUMV collections contain over 1.5 million specimens and serve as the primary repositories for vertebrates collected by past and present Cornellians doing research around the world. As a university based museum, it also serves as an important resource for undergraduate and graduate education. The CUMV is administered through the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. As a research institution, our specimens, tissue samples and related specimen data are available to qualified members of the scientific community affiliated with academic and research institutions. We especially encourage the use of the collections in student research, whether as thesis work, independent study, or class projects. Although there are no public exhibits at the museum, museum staff try to provide assistance to members of the Cornell Community whenever possible and do offer tours for classes and other interested groups.","Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates","159 Sapsucker Woods Road",,"Ithaca","New York","14850-1923","USA","Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates","159 Sapsucker Woods Road",,"Ithaca","NY","14850-1923","USA","42.480137","-76.451055","18000","11US744679/9",,,,

Ornithology: over 5,000 individual skin and skeletal specimens, nests and eggs, the scope of which extend over four continents.  The collection maintains over 400 genera and 700 species from 43 countries; among them include several Passenger Pigeons, (Ectopistes migratorius), a Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja), an Ostrich (Struthio camelus) and a Whooping Crane (Grus americana).   	Mammalogy: 4,332 total specimens from twenty-six countries and forty-four different states. Almost two thousand of these have been collected throughout Indiana. As well, the collection contains specimens from such places as Peru, Canada, Jamaica, Panama and Austria. Of particular note is the museum&rsquo;s collection of bat species from all around the world  	Vertebrate Paleontology:  139 specimens from 25 states and 15 countries. The Giant Beaver (Casteroides ohioensis) skeleton on display is the single most complete specimen of its species ever found.   	Herpetology: 1,290 specimens that includes 456 genera and 684 different species. Almost half of all the specimens are from Indiana and the surrounding area, providing a catalog of both native and invasive species. The collection also contains reptiles and amphibians from over 30 states and 19 countries.  	Invertebrates: over 40,000 species.  	Anthropology: over 1,800 pieces and has considerable teaching potential. It houses objects from many different countries including Egypt, Japan and the Americas. The JMM is not actively collecting archaeological or ethnographic materials, but maintains its current collection for educational purposes.","Joseph Moore Museum, Earlham College","801 National Road West",,"Richmond","IN","47374","USA","Earlham College","801 National Road West",,"Richmond","IN","47374","USA",,,"2570",,,,,

The herbarium contains over 200 plant specimens, including many older specimens from the 1950s and 1960s.  Our collection data are managed on Arctos and are searchable via an entomology collection portal, an herbarium portal, and through GBIF.  Genetic data (DNA barcodes) from KNWR specimens are posted on BOLD and GenBank.  Loans of KNWR specimens for research purposes are encouraged.  Since most KNWR arthropod specimens are eventually to be deposited at the University of Alaska Museum, please refer to the UAM entomology collection loan policy for general loan guidelines.    The arthropod collection contains about 20,000 specimens focused on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. All of the arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes, etc.) will be a single collection without the need for collection codes for the foreseeable future.

This valuable heritage has been enriched year by year thanks to specimens obtained through donations from private individuals, agreements with the Zoo and Catalonia’s natural parklands, and also through the Museum’s own research work.    Museum centres:   The Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona is housed in different buildings located in three strategic areas of the city: Ciutadella Park, Montjuïc Park and the Forum Park. The first of these sites is home to the Museu Martorell and the Laboratori de Natura in the building known as Castell dels Tres Dragons, while Montjuïc is home to the Jardí Botànic and the Jardí Botànic Històric. The Museu Blau is situated in the Forum Park, and houses the new facilities that are used mainly for public programmes: exhibitions, workshops, conferences, media resource centre, etc.    Museum Science Area:   This comprises the Collections and Research departments and the Documentation Centre, and all the activities undertaken by them, that is, conservation, description and study of the natural and documentary heritage of their resources. In fact, everything that goes on at the Museum would be pointless were it not for its fundamental, primary purpose which is to safeguard and preserve that heritage. The collections are kept in store and are preserved and studied by biologists and geologists who document them (taking inventory, cataloguing, computerising, and publishing databases) and make them available for the scientific community. They use the different laboratories –the preparation lab, the restoration and preventive conservation lab, and the technological lab– for these purposes. The Museum participates in research projects with other public institutions such as the CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones científicas) and national and foreign universities, while also developing its own projects connected with the collections it holds and with objectives relating to the local territory.

The research activities reflect the diversity of the eight scientific departments and their collections, which cover most group of invertebrates and vertebrates, extant and fossils, archeozoology, mineralogy and geology. With very active fieldwork schedule on most continents, research at the museum includes comprehensive taxonomic revisions, new taxa descriptions, annotated faunistic lists, phylogeny and phylogeography studies (both morphological and molecular based). These researches are crucial for the understanding and protection of the biodiversity, in Switzerland and world while. Several projects are financed yearly by national or international funds, including the Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland's foremost institution in the promotion of scientific research. Meetings and congress are often organized at the museum, and students from several universities receive a complete scientific training in systematic and taxonomy at the museum, based on collection studies and molecular techniques conducted at the museum's own laboratory. Based on its long tradition on the study of bats in Switzerland, the museum houses the Swiss Bat Center which coordinates the protection and study of bats in West Switzerland and holds a large bibliographic database.

The Museum is located at Kalvskinnet in the centre of Trondheim, along with its exhibitions, collections, administration and three of its sections. The Archaeometry Section is located at the Gløshaugen campus of NTNU. Ringve Botanical Gardens can be found at Lade, on the outskirts of Trondheim, and the Kongsvoll Alpine Garden is found in Kongsvoll, in Dovrefjell National Park. The NTNU University Museum has its origins in the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (DKNVS), founded in 1760. In 1926, the Society was reorganized into two sections: the Academy and the Museum. In 1968, the Norwegian Parliament approved a resolution to found the University of Trondheim and the Museum was transferred to the University on 1 April 1984. Further reorganization of the University led to the establishment of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) on 1 January 1996. Since 2005, the NTNU University Museum has been treated at the same level as the University faculties, with representation on the Council of Deans and the Central University Research Committee.","NTNU University Museum","Department of Natural History",,"Trondheim",,"NO-7491","Norway","Erling Skakkes gate 47A",,,"Trondheim",,"NO-7012","Norway","63.4291","10.3883","2809",,,,,

Research: Our curatorial staff and their students, faculty and students throughout the University of Alaska, state and federal agencies, and national and international researchers all use and improve the museum's collections through ongoing research projects ranging from short-term high school Science Symposium investigations to large-scale, multi-national, multi-institutional collaborations.    Teaching and Outreach: Our faculty curators and collections not only provide resources for academic training at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, but we are also heavily involved in community outreach, including school visits, public presentations, and workshops. We also mentor researchers at many levels, from high school to undergraduate and graduate students to postdoctoral researchers.    Collections:  The museum's collections include more than 1.4 million artifacts and specimens representing millions of years of biological diversity and thousands of years of cultural traditions in the North. Many of these are rare and unique, but there are also long series of specimens representing all aspects of regional natural history. Such series, often accumulated over decades, are a crucial resource for research. The collections are organized into 10 research disciplines.","PO Box 756960","907 Yukon Drive",,"Fairbanks","Alaska","99775-6960","USA","907 Yukon Drive",,,"Fairbanks","Alaska","99775-6960","USA",,,"2684",,,,,

Since 1879 the Herbarium of the Department of Botany of the University of Coimbra, Portugal (COI), has owned the Herbarium of the german (Saxonian) Henrich Moritz Willkomm, Professor at Prague University and a specialist on the flora of the Iberian Peninsula. This collection was bought to Willkomm and contains vascular and non-vascular plants of the Mediterranean area and the Macaronesian Islands and includes c. 10.000 species and over 30.000 specimens. The specimens were collected by Willkomm himself and other relevant botanical collectors of the time e.g., Bourgeau, Orphanides, Sieber, Lange, Loscos, Boissier, Reuter, Lagasca, Cavanilles. It was the basis for Willkomm & Lange's Prodromus Florae Hispanicae (1861-1880), the first comprehensive Flora of most of the Iberian Peninsula - only now being superseded by the Flora iberica (Castroviejo et al., 1986-, Madrid) - and contains many type specimens of Iberian taxa. Not all Willkomm specimens are at COI and some are scattered in other institutes. But this is by far the largest assemblage of his material and he regarded it as his core collection which, as a whole he sold to Júlio Henriques, the founder of COI.

Through the Biobank, a single port of entry for organisations requiring African wildlife biomaterials for research, biodiversity conservation and biotechnology development purposes has been established. An advisory committee oversees operational efficiency and strategy. Members represented on the committee are experts drawn from the stakeholder community, biomaterial sample providers, sample users, academics, national and provincial regulatory authorities.   The NZG Biobank is housed in a dedicated building with offices, fully equipped laboratories for processing and cryo-preservation, storerooms, and multiple rooms with fridges, freezers ranging from 4 degrees C to minus 150 degrees C, to ultralow (liquid nitrogen) temperatures.  The Bank coordinates, collects, processes and stores different tissue types such as extracted DNA, ear-notches, hair, feathers, semen, organs etc. and maintains the samples under different and optimal storage conditions that are suitable for future research and management applications.","NZG Biobank","P O Box 754",,"Pretoria","Gauteng","Yes","South Africa","232 Boom street",,,"Pretoria","Gauteng","Yes","South Africa",,,"23837",,,,,

The ATH boasts state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure for specimen processing and curation, photography, pest and climate control, and field, herbarium and laboratory research. The main activity is management of the more than 160,000 plant specimens that comprise the CNS collection, a merger of the collections (and staff) of the Australian National Herbarium Atherton (QRS), the Queensland Herbarium Mareeba (MBA) and part of the JCU Herbarium collection (JCT) to form an unsurpassed representative collection of north Queensland's flora. Research at the Australian Tropical Herbarium covers a range of topics including tropical plant and fungal taxonomy and evolution, ethnobotany, ecology, climate change studies, development of identification products, agroforestry and regional ecosystem mapping. We currently have two numbering systems: one for DNA and one for all other collections (herbarium sheets, spirit, woodblocks). For non DNA specimens- CNS:12345 ; For DNA materials- CNS(DNA):12345 This will change once we revise the management of DNA materials; these will be databased according to the voucher specimen held in our main collection.","P.O.

Between the years 1895 and 1897. M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 80 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the College's collection.  At present, student Victoria Jones is in the process of writing a proposal for Lake Forest College to pay more attention to the collection and thus salvage this one-of-a-kind herbarium. This proposal reflects Victoria's senior-thesis topic and all of the tedious curatorial work she has committed to for the past three years. Victoria is currently working alongside Gerould Wilhelm, the foremost vascular plant botanist of the Chicago Region, to observe truth and beauty in each specimen of the ETL Herbarium. The outcome will be Gerould Wilhelm's & Laura Rericha's brand new book, Flora of the Chicago Region. This book will update Swink & Wilhelm's Plants of the Chicago Region (1994).","555 North Sheridan Road",,,"Lake Forest","Illinois","60045","USA","555 North Sheridan Road",,,"Lake Forest","Illinois","60045","USA","42.2491","-87.8289","20334",,"1895","The majority of the collection contains specimens from Illinois Beach State Park (IBSP) collected by Elizabeth Teter Lunn (professor at Lake Forest College) between the 1950s and mid-1970s.

The goals of the collection are 1) to provide a reference collection for work performed by Natural Heritage Commission staff and their conservation partners, 2) to house voucher specimens for rare plant records in the database of the Arkansas Natural Heritage Program, and 3) to voucher plants of ecologically sensitive or otherwise significant lands, including those contained within the State's System of Natural Areas.

Its various activities present the nature and the characteristics of the canton Grisons to the broad public. A major aspect of the activities is documenting the nature of the Grisons and its changes. The rich collections and its own research suit this purpose.  Collections  The collections are the core of the museum and indispensable for science. Most objects of the collections come from Grisons. The oldest collections are 200 years old. Others were built up a short time ago and have been supplemented continuously. Especially worth mentioning are the collections from the Swiss National Park and the one of mammals.  Botany: The collection of vascular plants is extensive. The so-called &ldquo;Herbarium Raeticum&rdquo; covers examples of vascular plants collected in Graub&uuml;nden within the last 200 years. World-famous Josias Braun-Blanquet (1884-1980), a pioneer of plant ecology, had a herbarium of his own in his parental home in Chur. This herbarium is at the Natural History Museum of the Grisons, while his other herbariums are stored at the University of Montpellier. The oldest herbarium of the Museum was collected at the beginning of the 19th century by the B&uuml;ndner pastor Luzius Pool.  Zoology: Since the foundation of the museum mammals have been continuously collected. And since 1970 small mammals (rodents, insectivores, small carnivores) have been systematically sampled. This collection is one of the most extensive in the whole area of the Alps. Various collections from the Swiss National Park as well as the collection of butterflies by Thomann and the collection of snails by Wolf are scientifically significant. Recent collections are those of wild bees and butterflies.  Geology: The geological collections include many special pieces collected by well-known B&uuml;ndner geologists. The rock collection of big tunnel constructions in Grisons is outstanding. On display there are fossils from the region of the Swiss National Park, the region of Piz Aela (fish saurian) and relicts of fish saurian from the Ducan area near Davos. Fragments of cave bear bones &ndash; between 50&#39;000 and 100&#39;000 years old &ndash; were found in the caves of Sulzfluh near St. Ant&ouml;nien.","info@bnm.gr.ch","ueli.rehsteiner@bnm.gr.ch","sabrina.schnurrenberger@bnm.gr.ch","CH-7000 Chur","Graubünden","7000","Switzerland","Masanserstrasse 31",,,"CHUR",,,"Switzerland","46.8536","9.53451","23862","CH-024","1850","Switzerland, especially canton of Graubünden.",,

It belongs to the U. S. National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution) and has been housed at Georgia Southern University since 1990. The collection contains specimens from all continents, most of the approximately 860 known species of ticks, and a quarter of the primary tick types.  Ticks (Ixodida) are haematophagous mites (Acari). During their blood meal, ticks can acquire and/or transmit a number of microorganisms, some of which can cause diseases in humans, domestic and wild animals. Because of the impact of ticks on human and veterinary medicine, the USNTC is not only a significant resource of material and information for tick taxonomists but also for public health officials.","Institute for Coastal Plain Science","75 Georgia Avenue, Building 204","PO BOX 8056","Statesboro","GA","30460-8056","USA",,,,,,,"USA",,,"25418",,,,,

We also provide a variety of tours for other interested parties, and field many telephone inquiries from the press and public concerning mysterious fishes and other ichthyological matters.  Our primary mission is to support teaching and research in the areas of ichthyology, fisheries biology, aquatic biology, conservation, and biodiversity, and to provide a source of ichthyological information for the public. We maintain a large archival collection of preserved fishes from the Pacific Northwest and around the world, and we make this valuable material available for study both to visitors in the collection and through a program of gifts, loans, and exchanges.","University of Washington Fish Collection","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences","1140 NE Boat St., room 005","Seattle","Washington","98105","USA",,,,,,,"USA",,,"17995","10US099308/9",,,,

All collections except the birds collection and the mammals collection rank within the 15th largest in North America.  These collections, some of which date back over 150 years, represent the most complete record of Illinois biota anywhere.  Most collections are also global in geographic coverage for many groups.  Because these specimens document the presence of species through time, our collections are an invaluable resource for tracking changes in species distributions as habitats have been modified.  The collections are regularly used in scientific research to recognize threatened and endangered species, determine the arrival and spread of exotic and invasive species, provide baseline data for ecological restoration projects, evaluate habitat quality over time and space, assess the effects of climate change, locate populations of medical or economic importance, resolve evolutionary relationships, discover new species, and facilitate species identification through comparative morphology and DNA barcoding.  Many specimen records are available online through web-based searchable databases accessible to scientists, resource managers, policy makers, and the public.","Illinois Natural History Survey","1816 South Oak St.",,"Champaign","Illinois","61820","USA","Illinois Natural History Survey","1816 South Oak St.",,"Champaign","Illinois","61820","USA",,,"18008",,,,,

We also have smaller collections of mammals, insects, and plants.  The bird collection consists of approximately 67,000 study skins, 9,000 skeletons, and 36,000 clutches of eggs. We also maintain a small tissue collection containing samples from eastern North American taxa.  The collection, worldwide in scope, has especially strong collections of Philippine and Central and South American birds. The holdings represent about 4,000 bird species. About 140 taxa are in the type collection.    The Museum&#39;s mollusk collection consists of more than 2 million specimens, making it one of the top twelve in the United States. The 220,000 cataloged lots represent more than 18,000 species. Worldwide in scope and covering all seven living classes of mollusks, our holdings comprise marine Gastropoda (50%), land and freshwater Gastropoda (25%), marine Bivalvia (15%), and freshwater Bivalvia (5%). The Museum&#39;s mollusk collection is primarily dry shells, with some alcohol preserved cephalopod specimens.  Most specimens are recent; however there is some Cenozoic fossil material. Our type collection contains more than 1,200 lots.   The mammal collection consists of approximately 6,000 specimens (skins, skulls, &amp; skeletons). About half of the collection is Philippine bats and rodents, most collected by D.S. Rabor; the remaining half is North American mammals.   The insect collection contains approximately 1,500 specimens primarily from eastern North America.   The herbarium contains nearly 400 specimens, primarily from the eastern United States and mostly collected since 1980.","P.O.

Since that time, the museum has had a long and distinguished history, including being designated as the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in 1987 by the Oklahoma Legislature and receiving the state&#39;s first National Medal in 2014 awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.  Curators and staff of the museum conduct scientific investigations to preserve and develop a greater understanding and appreciation of natural resources and human cultural heritage. They develop exhibitions and conduct educational programs for all ages that illustrate, interpret and explain the natural history of the state and region to bring a greater understanding of our world to the people of Oklahoma and others.  On May 1, 2000, the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History opened its doors to a new 198,000 square foot facility housing 12 collections, labs, libraries, offices and exhibit space. Today, the treasure chest design of the building&#39;s architecture houses more than 10 million objects that belong to the people of the state of Oklahoma. Over 4 billion years of Oklahoma&rsquo;s natural history are featured in thousands of artifacts from the collections on display in 50,000 feet of public galleries. Visitors can immerse themselves in the fascinating natural and cultural history of Oklahoma.    	Our Mission  The Sam Noble Museum at The University of Oklahoma inspires minds to understand the world through collection-based research, interpretation and education.    	Our Vision  As one of the finest museums, we are at the heart of our community, collectively working to inspire understanding, appreciation and stewardship of the earth and its peoples.","University of Oklahoma","2401 Chautauqua Ave.",,"Norman","OK Oklahoma","73072","USA",,,,,,,,,,"23721",,,,,

Archbold is located in Venus, south-central Florida. Since inception in 1941, Archbold Biological Station has prioritized the development and curation of an on-site, multi-taxon, specimen-based, natural history collection. The collection of specimens is necessary for research at the Station and for outside investigators, emphasizing two essential activities -- the identification of species and documentation of biodiversity. After decades of steady growth the Archbold collection includes more than 250,000 well-preserved, and well-labeled specimens of plants, birds, fish, herptiles, mammals and arthropods. The Archbold collection is probably unrivalled in scope and size among biological field station collections in North America, and is likely one of the largest on-site collections encompassing the taxonomic diversity of a single (3,577-ha) site in the U.S.A. Our diverse natural history reference collection is a key component of the Station&rsquo;s infrastructure, serving a broad community of staff researchers, visiting investigators and students, and supplying collection material and information to outside investigators. Plant specimens have been used in studies of community ecology, such as the response of vegetation to fire. The vertebrate collection was designed for studies of variation, growth patterns, life histories, and population dynamics of local vertebrates. The arthropod collection contributes to numerous studies needing insect identification, as well as providing large numbers of specimens with ecological data.","123 Main Drive",,,"Venus","Florida","33960","USA",,,,,,,,,,"23796",,,,,

Division of Entomology is one of the first five Divisions of Indian Agricultural Research Institute established in 1905. The Division has pioneered in investigations in insect systematics and economic entomology vis-a-vis important crop pests. National Pusa Collections (NPC) with over five lakh specimen serves as a national repository for insect pests of crops.   	  	Eminent entomologists like H.M. Lefroy, T. B. Fletcher and M. G. R. Menon laid strong foundation for insect systematics research in NPC. Faunistic surveys led to the establishment of the National Pusa Collection (NPC), one of the largest collections of its kind in this world. Now this collection houses more than half a million specimens of which 0.1 million are authentically identified, comprising about 20,000 species. Over the last 50 years, 1500 new species of insects have been described from NPC. As a national service for pest diagnostics, every year, over 4000 specimens are identified by the taxonomists of this Division. Several taxonomic treatises on agriculturally important insects belonging to orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Hymenoptera and class Acarina have been made from this Division.","National Pusa Collection","Division of Entomology","ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute","New Delhi","Delhi","110012","India",,,,,,,,,,"25732",,,,,

The largest of the collections, in terms of numbers, is the extensive insect collection, which accounts for approximately half of all specimens.  The collections date back to 1792 and include material from the museums of the Royal Dublin Society (1792-1877), Royal Irish Academy (1798-1890) and Museum of Irish Industry (1845-1867).","Merrion Street",,,"Dublin",,,"Ireland",,,,,,,,,,"24142",,,,,

They include representatives of all major groups with strengths in reptiles and amphibians, fish, insects, corals, crustaceans and molluscs, with smaller collections of mammals and birds. The majority of specimens are from Trinidad &amp; Tobago but there are many from the surrounding region. The core of the collection came from the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture established in the 1920s. This evolved into the University of the West Indies. Other local collections have been merged with the UWIZM, these include the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC), The Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI), and the zoological specimens from the National Museum of Trinidad &amp; Tobago (NMTT).   In many older publications the collection is known as the Land Arthropod Collection of the University of the West Indies.","The University of the West Indies Zoology Museum","Department of Life Sciences","The University of The West Indies","St. Augustine","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","Trinidad and Tobago",,,,,,,,,,"24430",,,,,

The Museum collects, preserves, exhibits, and disseminates material that contributes to an understanding and appreciation of the state.  		The Nevada State Museum &amp; Historical Society opened to the public in November 1982. At the time of its completion, the building at 700 Twin Lakes Drive in Lorenzi Park was the largest structure of its kind in Nevada built expressly as a museum. The Museum in Lorenzi Park had three major galleries: Biological Sciences, Geological Sciences and History/Prehistory. The museum also included a changing exhibit gallery, various corridor exhibitions, a research library, and collection storage.  		In 2000, the Nevada voters approved an appropriation that included the construction of a new museum facility at the Springs Preserve and during the 2007 legislative session, the museum&rsquo;s name was officially changed to Nevada State Museum, Las Vegas. The construction of the new building was completed in the spring of 2009. Two years later, the 2011 legislature voted to approve the opening of the new museum. The new building, located 309 S. Valley View Blvd, opened to the public October 2011.  		With 70,000 square-feet of exhibit, library, collection storage, and public space, the new Nevada State Museum at the Springs Preserve is double the size of the former location at Lorenzi Park. The additional space allows for the display and interpretation of new artifacts such as paleontological fossils and new collections such as the 8,000 piece Folies Berg&egrave;re costume archive. Objects from the museum&rsquo;s collections that have never before been exhibited can now be seen on display at the state-of-the-art facility.  		In addition to our own mission, we are guided by the mission, vision, and philosophy, of the Division of Museums and History:  		  			MISSION  		The Division of Museums and History preserves, shares, and promotes the understanding, and celebration of Nevada&rsquo;s natural and cultural heritage for the enrichment of all generations.  		  			VISION  		Recognized as the most trusted stewards and engaging storytellers of Nevada&rsquo;s heritage.  		  			PHILOSOPHY  		We will work as a team to build consensus and fulfill our vision, putting the public&rsquo;s needs first while adhering to the highest professional standards.","309 S.

Our research collections are the records of this journey as they house artifacts and specimens that date back to our very beginnings and that span 5 different divisions of scientific study &ndash; Anthropology, Botany, Geology, Invertebrate Zoology, and Vertebrate Zoology. Through the years, we&rsquo;ve seen our collections grow from just a handful of artifacts and natural specimens to now over 700,000, with the majority of these specimens being of local provenance. While we are considered a smaller institution on a national level, we proudly hold the most extensive cultural and natural record in the world of the Greater Niagara Region, and we continually strive to offer the members of our local community and to the scientific community at large access to these natural resources. Overall, we seek not only to &ldquo;Inspire Curiosity through Exploration&rdquo;, but also to impart a greater understanding of the natural world to the general public.","1020 Humboldt Parkway",,,"Buffalo","New York","14211","USA",,,,,,,,,,"20683",,,,,

The wet, alcohol-preserved collection is exceptionally rich, with over 1,000,000 specimens, nearly half of which are Trichoptera, or caddisflies, resulting from 40 years of work by Director Emeritus Dr. John Morse. Another highly noteworthy subcollection is the black fly (Simuliidae) collection maintained by Dr. Peter Adler, comprising &gt;10,000 specimens, both dry and wet-preserved. The pinned, dry collection comprises about 300,000 specimens, with strong representation of southeastern U.S. species of all the major orders.","E-249 Poole Agricultural Center",,,"Clemson","SC","29634-0310","USA","312 & 314 Long Hall",,,"Clemson","SC","29634-0310","USA","34°40'41.0""N","82°50'04.9""W","23788",,,,,

The mission of the African Centre for DNA Barcoding is to fill the knowledge gap and strengthen research frameworks for international, regional and inter-institutional co-operation in Africa, especially in the modern field of DNA technology for biodiversity science, such as DNA Barcoding.     ACDB has setup a DNA Bank focusing on plants:  1. Mission of the DNA Bank  Southern Africa has the richest temperate flora in the world with more than 24 000 taxa of 368 families, including more than 10% of the world&#39;s vascular plant flora on less than 2.5% of the earth&#39;s land surface area. Our Bank aims to preserve representative genetic information of the high diversity presented by southern African flora as a resource to be utilized in plant research by current and future generations.  2. Purpose of the Bank  Its main purpose is to enhance plant taxonomic and evolutionary studies by providing:    	  		Permanent storage of Plant DNA material  	  		Documentation of each sample in a database online  	  		DNA aliquots. This is subjected to the recipient&#39;s compliance with the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).    3. Policies  Policies have been developed in line with the UN Convention for Biological Diversity. Samples will not be made available for bio-prospecting endeavors or any other commercial application.  4. Available taxa in the DNA Bank  The UJ DNA Bank currently contains over 12 000 samples either extracted (Doyle and Doyle, 1987) or as desiccated leaves in silica bags. Each sample is vouchered (JRAU or BNRH).","African Centre for DNA Barcoding (ACDB)","Department of Botany and Plant Biotechnology","University of Johannesburg","Johannesburg","Gauteng","2006","South Africa",,,,,,,,,,"23869",,,,,

The collection maintains over 400 genera and 700 species from 43 countries; among them include several Passenger Pigeons, (Ectopistes migratorius), a Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja), an Ostrich (Struthio camelus) and a Whooping Crane (Grus americana).   Mammalogy: 4,332 total specimens from twenty-six countries and forty-four different states. Almost two thousand of these have been collected throughout Indiana. As well, the collection contains specimens from such places as Peru, Canada, Jamaica, Panama and Austria. Of particular note is the museum&rsquo;s collection of bat species from all around the world  Vertebrate Paleontology:  139 specimens from 25 states and 15 countries. The Giant Beaver (Casteroides ohioensis) skeleton on display is the single most complete specimen of its species ever found.   Herpetology: 1,290 specimens that includes 456 genera and 684 different species. Almost half of all the specimens are from Indiana and the surrounding area, providing a catalog of both native and invasive species. The collection also contains reptiles and amphibians from over 30 states and 19 countries.  Invertebrates: over 40,000 species.  Anthropology: over 1,800 pieces and has considerable teaching potential. It houses objects from many different countries including Egypt, Japan and the Americas.

This Strategic plan was designed with the aim of catalyzing the conservation of threatened amphibians in Ecuador. Six programs (with numerous projects) were set in this plan: (1) research and monitoring of native amphibians, (2) strengthening of local capacities, (3) management and ex situ conservation of species at risk, (4) in situ conservation; (5) public education, and (6) bioinformatics and sharing of information.

Our living collection is available for on-site studies involving observation, interactive trials, and non-invasive manipulative techniques. Biological specimens are collected opportunistically (e.g., during routine physical exams and necropsies) and total more than 10,000 samples of various types (e.g., blood, serum, urine, hair, organ tissues, cadavers, etc.).  The public availability of corresponding datasets based on historic life history data and medical records allow studies using our living colony and biobank to employ a holistic approach.- large sample sizes, longitudinal data and samples that in many cases span an animal&rsquo;s entire life, exact dates of events, and large numbers of individuals from closely related yet biologically diverse primate taxa make the DLC resource unique.

After Haussknecht’s death in 1903 and execution of a foundation from his estate, the collections were maintained and increased by Joseph Bornmüller (1862–1948). After World War II, the collections were moved to Jena and were affiliated to the Institute of Systematic Botany of the Friedrich Schiller University, to which they officially belonged since the 1920s. Actually, the Herbarium Haussknecht houses about 3.5 Million herbarium specimens, being one of the major European herbaria. Carl Haussknecht started plant collecting not earlier than in the mid-1850s. Compared with the size of the entire collection, there is a rather low number of older material at JE. Such historical collections include for example the herbaria of Christian Ehrenfried Weigel (1748–1831) and Johann Friedrich Glaser (1707–1789), which are kept separately. Other collections containing large amounts of old material are the herbaria of Charles Gaillardot (1814–1883) and Wilhelm Gerhard (1780–1858), both acquired by Haussknecht, and those of Alwin Georges (1823–1893) and Thilo Irmisch (1816–1879). Besides the widely distributed exsiccata, like those of Friedrich Metz (1819–1885) and Franz Sieber (1789–1844), these collections include even rarer material, for example specimens collected by Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein (1768–1826), Anton Rochel (1770–1847), and Johan Peter Rottler (1749–1836).","Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena","Herbarium Haussknecht (JE)","Fürstengraben 1","Jena","Thüringen","07743","Germany",,,,,,,,,,"25484",,,,,

The Museum, which is a facility of the Shell Museum and Educational Foundation, Inc., received its first accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums in March 2010.  In addition to its 40+ exhibits, public programs, and in-house live-mollusk demonstrations, the museum has embarked on many collaborations with national and international educational and research institutions, and offers facilities in its collection and research area for visiting researchers, interns, and students. Resources are used by national and international professionals in the fields of environmental and marine sciences, biology, and ecology. The Museum also offers a formal field trip program for Lee County public school 4th-graders on a cost-sharing basis. The Museum has established strong ties with many public and private sector organizations, including the United Nations&rsquo; Food and Agricultural Organization, Smithsonian Institution, American Malacological Society, Conchologists of America, Museu de Zoologia and Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil, Florida Museum of Natural History, Southwest Florida Library Network, Sanibel Public Library, The Sanibel School, Sanibel-Captiva Chamber of Commerce, Lee County&rsquo;s Visitor and Convention Bureau and the Tourism and Development Council, and shell clubs throughout Florida.
